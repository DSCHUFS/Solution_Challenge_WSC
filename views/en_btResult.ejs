                                    According to 'the Status of Registered Persons with Disabilities (2019)',

                                <p>According to 'Supreme Prosecutors‚Äô Office Crime Analysis Report (2017)', 
                                    the crime rate of non-disabled people is 15 times higher 
                                    than that of people with mental illness.
                                    Despite the extremely low crime rate of people with mental illness, 
                                    people tend to react sensitively toward them.
                                    This is because people are not aware of 'mental illness'. </p><br>

                                <p>Korea used to adopt the disability grading system

                                    But this has been abolished and now adopt 
                                    two-tier system as a measure of disability security:
                                    severe disability(between 1 and 3), mild disability(between 4 and 6).
