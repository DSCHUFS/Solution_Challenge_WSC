                                        the crime rate of non-disabled people is 15 times higher 
                                        than that of people with mental illness.
                                        Despite the extremely low crime rate of people with mental illness, 
                                        people tend to react sensitively toward them.
                                        This is because people are not aware of 'mental illness'. </p><br>
